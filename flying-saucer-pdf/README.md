# Flying-saucer PDF

Flying Saucer is a pure-Java library for rendering arbitrary well-formed XML (or XHTML) using CSS 2.1 for layout and formatting, output to Swing panels, PDF, and images.

The flying-saucer-pdf module extends this functionality by enabling the generation of PDF documents. It integrates with PDF libraries like OpenPDF to convert well-formed XHTML and associated CSS into PDF files.
